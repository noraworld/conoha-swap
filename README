If a swapfile is needed, it should be created as the name "swapfile".
Remember to commentout the corresponding line in /etc/fstab.

For example, if you want to create 1 GB swapfile, you should run the following:
$ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap/swapfile bs=1M count=1024
$ sudo mkswap /swap/swapfile
$ sudo chmod 600 /swap/swapfile
$ sudo swapon /swap/swapfile

And uncomment the following line in /etc/fstab.
/swap/swapfile          swap                    swap    defaults        0 0

In case of you want to delete a swapfile, disable a swapfile and delete it.
$ sudo swapoff /swap/swapfile
$ sudo rm /swap/swapfile

And commentout the corresponding line in /etc/fstab.

To know how much swap storage is reserved, use free command or see /proc/swaps.
$ free
$ cat /proc/swaps
